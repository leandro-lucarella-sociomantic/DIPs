## Abstract

A proposal to expose a way to selectively disable some of D's contract features
(invariant, `in` / `out` and `assert`).


### Links

https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/6347


## Description

Add a command-line switch, named `-contracts` in this proposal, which takes
4 possible values:

- `all`: the default, present for completeness and scripts, so one can just
  append it to a generated command line to enable all contract checks.
- `noinvariant`: Disable implicit `invariant` calls, but leave in function `in`
  / `out` contracts and `assert`.
- `assert`: Disable `invariant` blocks and `in` / `out` contracts, but leave
  `assert` in.
- `none`: Disable all `invariant`, `in` and `out` contracts, and `assert`.

Note that the `noinvariant` value only disables implicit calls to `invariant`.
Explicit calls can only be disabled by disabling `assert`.


### Rationale

#### Prelude on contracts

Under the broad name "Contracts", we regroup four D features: `assert`, `in`
contracts, `out` contracts and `invariant`. Contracts in D are a means to do
sanity checking. A contract that fails is a sign of faulty logic in the code.
Since contracts should never fail, the currently advertised approach for
D programmers is to use them during development, then deploy a `-release` build
of the application for maximum performance.

Contracts naturally fit in a hierarchy, where `assert` is the most basic block
(being used by others), and `invariant` is meant for expensive sanity checking.
`in` and `out` contracts are located in between.

#### Cost of contracts

`assert` and `in` / `out` contracts follow a pay-for-what-you-use approach: an
`assert` which is never executed is free, and a `in` or `out` contract on
a function that is never called is also free of runtime overhead.

`invariant`s stand out in that regard: they can be used on
a pay-for-what-you-use basis, by using `assert(object)` (or `assert(this)`), but
they are also implicitly called twice on every `public` and `protected` class
method call. The call itself is not direct: the compiler inserts a call to
`_d_invariant`, [which can be found in
druntime](https://github.com/dlang/druntime/blob/v2.072.0/src/rt/invariant.d).
The code, being very simple, results in the class hierarchy being traversed
completely twice (no caching is done) for every call, even for classes which do
not define any invariant.

Profiling some real-time applications within Sociomantic showed that
`_d_invariant` was the most expensive call in the application. Affected
applications were using few or no invariants, but since Sociomantic code is
mostly written in an OOP style, simply disabling invariants (with no other
optimization) led to 20% more throughput.

#### Issues with the current approach

Testing can be complete and it is not rare to miss a scenario that can show up
any time in a production setting. In such a case, having a contract not failing
where it should can lead to higher costs than the one induced by a crash of the
application. Examples of such a case include critical data corruption and
unexpected monetary spending.

For this reason, developers are often wary of disabling such safety features,
even in production, as long as the performance cost is acceptable. What can be
viewed as an acceptable performance cost is up to the end user and the code
base. Any OOP-intensive code will want to get rid of `invariant` as a first
step, while more function-oriented code might be more interested in disabling
`in` / `out`.

#### Relationship with `-release` and `-debug`

In DMD, `-debug` just mean enabling `debug` blocks, so there is no overlap with
`-contracts`'s proposed functionality. On the other hand, `-release` disables
all aforementioned contracts, and, in addition, disables "switch errors"
(compiler-generated `default` case in a switch statement are turned into HLT
instruction instead of throwing a `SwitchError`). As a result, using
`-contracts` with `-release` is equivalent to just using `-release`.

#### Considered alternatives

The 4 values available to the user are voluntarily simple and hierarchical. It
makes little sense to allow any contracts without enabling asserts. It would be
feasible to allow `invariant` without `in` and `out` contracts, or only `out`
contracts, only `in` contracts, or some other combination. Since providing all
combinations would increase complexity, but doesn't yet provide an obvious
advantage, it was left out of this proposal (but can be subject to another one).

While a higher granularity is not recommended by the DIP author, it was one of
the most discussed points on the review thread, with several people expression
an interest in the feature.

Since this proposal was heavily motivated by the cost of invariants, an obvious
alternative is to reduce said cost. However, the cost of having `invariant`
enabled will never be null for builds that do not use invariants at all, which
is the real motivation for this feature.

Finally, this functionality is already implemented in LDC via
`-enable-invariants={0,1}`. Standardizing it would simplify users' lives and
allow tooling that deals with multiple compilers (e.g. `dub`, IDEs...) to
provide this option.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

Since this behavior is entirely opt-in, no breakage is expected.

### Implementation difficulty

The reference front-end already segments the affected features into separate
flags, hence the implementation should be trivial.
